This assignment was about creating a timer-based quiz with JavaScript

The application has a few multiple choice questions and the ability to store top scores on the user's device. 

Once the user clicks start, the timer runs in additiion to the questions. The user has 55 seconds to complete the quiz and if the user gets one wrong the timer subtracts 10 seconds. Once done, the time remaining is used for the score. After the user is done they are able to input their initals to save their score.
